(and give the domain(s)) 4 Communication and presentation skills 1 Data visualization 
In this course, i'm looking forward to honing my programming and machine learning 
skills. With this, in combination with the experimental stats class, I hope to excel 
in the areas of programming, math and statistics for this semester. In the program 
i am hoping to improve on machine learning and domain expertise since i really have 
no experience in either.
